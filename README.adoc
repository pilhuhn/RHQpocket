== RHQPocket
Testbed to create an application for Android(TM)-based devices
as management frontend for RHQ (http://jboss.org/rhq).

The client runs against RHQ 4.4 and later and required Android 3.0+.

Classes in org.rhq.core.domain are copied over manually
and the JaxB Annotations are stripped off (if needed )
as Android can not (directly) use JAXB classes.

=== Building

The build has now been moved over to the new Android tooling
build system that uses Gradle. TO build the software you need to
install Gradle (or use it out of Android Studio) and run

  gradle build
