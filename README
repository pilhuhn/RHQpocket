Testbed to create an application for Android(TM)-based devices
as management frontend for RHQ (http://rhq-project.org/).

The client runs against RHQ 4.4 and later and required Android 3.0+.

Classes in org.rhq.core.domain are copied over manually
and the JaxB Annotations are stripped off (if needed )
as Android can not (directly) use JAXB classes.
